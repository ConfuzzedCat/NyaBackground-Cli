# NyaBackground-Cli


A simple console program that downloads a image from nekos.life and merge it with "bg.png", a background of your chose. 
It also downscales images larger than you bg image to fit horizontal first.
(So if the downloadeed image is very big portait, it will match the x coordinate first, but if it is less than the bg's x, it will do y)
Still a WIP and works on Linux (but it won't change the background automatically).

Also it Im bad at coding, so might not be optimized or good at all, but it works. 
Memory usage is around ~100MB and CPU spikes at under 10% (R5 2600x).
