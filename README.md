# NyaBackground-Cli


A simple console program that downloads a image from nekos.life and merge it with "bg.png", a background of your choose. 

Still a WIP and works on Linux(but wont change the background automatically).

Also it Im bad at coding, so might not be optimized or good at all, but it works. 
Memory usage is around ~100MB and CPU spikes at under 10% (R5 2600x).
